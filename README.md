# üß† Philosophers
**Without bonus**

A multithreaded simulation of the classic **Dining Philosophers Problem** using **threads** and **mutexes** in C.
This project explores concurrency, synchronization, and resource sharing in a deadlock-free environment.

## Overview
The **Dining Philosophers Problem** models a group of philosophers sitting around a table, each alternating between **thinking**, **eating**, and **sleeping**. Forks are shared resources placed between each pair of philosophers, and a philosopher needs both their left and right fork to eat.

The simulation:

- Stops if a philosopher **dies of starvation**
- Optionally ends if all philosophers have eaten a given number of times

## Rules
Each philosopher must alternate between **thinking**, **eating**, and **sleeping**

- A philosopher **must hold both forks** to eat
- A philosopher dies if they don‚Äôt eat within `time_to_die` milliseconds
- Philosophers **do not communicate**
- Forks are shared and protected with **mutexes**

**No global variables** allowed

## How It Works
Each philosopher is a thread. The shared forks are represented by mutexes. Philosophers:

1. **Take forks**
2. **Eat** for `time_to_eat` ms
3. **Sleep** for `time_to_sleep` ms
4. **Think**, then repeat

If a philosopher doesn‚Äôt eat within the allowed time, they **die**, ending the simulation.
## Installation
To install the project and run the simulation:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DarynaSerhieieva/philosophers.git
```
2. **Navigate into the project folder:**
Open a folder:
```bash
cd philosophers/philo
```
## Compilation
Compile using the provided Makefile:
```bash
make
```
Targets:

- `make`: builds the executable philo

- `make clean`: removes object files

- `make fclean`: removes object files and the executable

- `make re`: rebuilds everything

## Usage
Use your **own data** instead of `number_of_philosophers`, `time_to_die`, `time_to_eat`, `time_to_sleep` and `[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`(optional argument)
```bash
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
## Example
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
```
This starts 5 philosophers who:
- Die after 800ms without eating,
- Eat for 200ms,
- Sleep for 200ms.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:**
If you **don‚Äôt provide** the optional `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat` argument, the simulation will run **indefinitely** until a philosopher dies of starvation.
If the simulation is stable and no philosopher dies, it may run **forever**, using **constant CPU resources** ‚Äî especially with many philosophers.

To manually **stop** the simulation at any time, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
 
To run the simulation with a defined stop condition (e.g., each philosopher eats 5 times), use:
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200 5
```
